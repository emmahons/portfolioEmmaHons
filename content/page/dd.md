This project is based on the works of Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec and their book ‘Dear Data’. This is a visualization of a week in the life. For one entire week, all habits and whereabouts were tracked. This resulted in a full dataset to work with. After analyzing this data, two different visualizations were created; one that focuses on location during the week and another that shows how the time was spent. These visualizations offered an interesting insight on the quickly passing weeks.

This project started with a clean notebook that fits my smallest pocket. In this notebook I then noted, as meticulously as possible, everything I did, with whom and how I felt while doing it. After writing this all down for a full week, I started the datamining process. By looking at the data and analyzing it, I got a better understanding of the interesting information. With this, I then sketched out different possibilities and worked out two final versions. These physical versions, with pencil on paper, were later converted to a digital format.
