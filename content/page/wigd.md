title: What is Good Design?
uitleg: The project started with research about Smith. As he is well known for
  his stripes, there is much more to him as a designer. We ended up opting for a
  simple, clean design. The color palette is based off his brand and thus fits
  in to Smithâ€™s house style.

For this project, a quote from iconic designer Paul Smith was taken about good design. From here, a poster, bookspread, instragram post and animated video were created. Of each designs exists a version with image and one without. These were created in a similar style so as to have a coherent brand.
