title: The Twice-Burned Library
uitleg: For this book design, I tried to capture the fragility of the knowledge and lives lost during the fires. I tried to capture this feeling by using very thin paper, an 'old-looking' font and pictures that appear to be leaflets in between pages. I primarily worked with the  orange (and blue) to capture the colors of fire.
